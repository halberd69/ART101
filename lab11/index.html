					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to have the user input a name and then alphabetize it. For example, I would enter 
						my name Halei and expect to get back Aehil.
					</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>No problems really arose, the instructions on Canvas, lecture, and section were sufficient and clear enough for us
						to accomplish the assignment without much of a hitch. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment made me feel like I am understanding jQuery more because this lab was so straightforward and 
						I could understand what was happening line by line. </p>
