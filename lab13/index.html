			<h1>Lab 13 - Loops</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to practice working with if-else statements, and using user input to determine
						what calculations must be done and what to print out.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>This lab was the most challenging so far, and I am grateful I have a reliable partner of whom helped me work together my code.
						I added console.log to determine whether or not my button was being activated because the output was not showing up in the beginning.
						Eventually I got it to work, but I wish I could ask the TA for more clarification (I fully respect and understand the strike). </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This was definitely a little bit more challenging, I still feel like I'm stuck in another programming language and JS code conventions are
						still something I need to get more familiar with.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					Where should we stop? <input type ="number" min=0 max="1000" id = "max"<br>
					Which factors should print what? <br>
					<table>
						<tr>
							<th>Factor</th>
							<th>Prints what?</th>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td><input type = "number" min = 0 max = "23" id ="num0"></td>
							<td><input type = "text" id="text0"></td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td><input type = "number" min = 0 max = "23" id ="num1"></td>
							<td><input type = "text" id="text1"></td>
