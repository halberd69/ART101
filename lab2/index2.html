<h1> HELLO WORLD! </h1>
<div class="minor-section">
<p>
    My name is Halei Fung! I am 22 years old, and I am from Los Angeles. I like to play games and eat cookies.
    My current favorite game is Nier Automata, I can't stop thinking about it everyday. In my free time I like hanging out
    with my friends and spending time with my partner.
    My partner's name is Samantha Lung! She is a kind person and a great artist. Samantha is an AGPM major just like I am,
    and we are both third year transfers. She and I have a lot in common, we like to watch a lot of the same shows, and we play a lot of the same games.
    Samantha is one of my first friends I made here at UC Santa Cruz!
