			<h1>Lab 15 - AJAX</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to practice using AJAX and JSON syntax in order to access information from different sources.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Honestly, JSON, API, and AJAX syntax is really hard for me to grasp, and my partner felt the same. We had a very basic understanding of
						what was happening, but to execute code ourselves was very difficult. I hope the TA's for this class are doing well and I wish them the 
						best of luck in their protest. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> APIs are really interesting and I can imagine all the cool different ways you can work with them. Although this lab was difficult and we had to resort to
						outside resources for help, I would be interested in practicing some more using AJAX, JSON, and APIs to see what other things I could create. </p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Ask a yes or no question and I will decide your fate.</p>
