			<h1>Lab 9 - Libraries and jQuery</h1>
			<section>			
			<div id = "challenge" class="section-button">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to practice using libraries and jQuery in order to directly modify elements.
						We did this by creating buttons on our page and had them perform different functions when clicked on.
					</p>

			<div id = "problems" class="section-button">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> The main problem that arose for me was that the buttons for the challenge and reflection sections were working,
						but the button in the challenge section did not do anything when I clicked on it. The code looked entirely
						identical between all the buttons and I did not see any error messages come up, so I was confused for a while.
						It wasn't until I realized that my challenge button was lacking a # in the click listener code that I was able to
						solve the issue. Other than that, it was relatively smooth sailing.  </p>

		<section>
			<div id = "reflection" class="section-button">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>At first I did not understand why we needed jQuery, nor what it really did. At first I thought we were putting 
						stylistic elements into a js file and not the css file and became confused about that, but after working on this 
						assignment, I now see that all the styling is still done in the css file, we are just accessing it through jQuery.</p>
