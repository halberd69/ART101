			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to create links to other files in our tree by correctly pathing them. We created a
						local file structure and edited the index files already available in the ART101 folder.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Because the lecture had discussed parent and child files along with pathing demonstrations, all my previous issues I had regarding that topic have been
						resolved. I feel like I understand Java and CSS more now.
					</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This was a relatively easy and straight forward assignment for my partner and I.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>Take a look at my file structure down below.</p>
