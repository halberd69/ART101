			<h1>Lab 8 - Anon Functions</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab is to experiment and familiarize ourselves with anon functions and callback functions.
						We were to define an array, and then take the elements from that array and put it through functions that would do 
						various mathematical conversions on them. We did this by using callback functions and anon functions.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> The main problem was getting used to the syntax, and figuring out the difference between anon and callback functions.
						I see now that anon functions are just functions without a name, and callback functions are functions that can be used as
						parameters for another function. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> This assignment was pretty fun to work through, I like problem solving and was good practice for me as someone who hasn't
						coded in a while. I think the things that you can do with functions are pretty cool, and it is interesting to see Java 
						be so lenient and accept functions as parameters for other functions.
