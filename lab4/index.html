			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocode</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The purpose of the lab was to show that writing pseudocode can help you problem solve through
						your coding problems.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I did not feel very good on the day I was working on this project. My abdomen was in a lot of pain and I had to take a lot
						of breaks to cope with the cramping. But other than that, I did not really encounter any problems with the assignment itself. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment reminds me of my other coding assignments I had in community college where we had to draw out
					our code in order to understand what we were doing. I still draw out my code to this day, and it was one of
					the most helpful skills I learned for coding. Pseudocode is a very similar process to this, and I recognize
					the value in writing out good pseudocode.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> Pseudocode for putting on makeup!
						<ol>
							<li>Prep face with moisturizer and sunscreen, rub the product onto the whole face gently.</li>
							<li>Take out eyebrow products, eyeshadow and brush, and fill in brows.</li>
							<li>Take out eyeshadow and eyeshadow brush, and brush the product onto eyelids.</li>
							<li>Put on eyeliner with eyeliner felt tip brush.</li>
							<li>Take out the lipstick product, and fill in the top and bottom lip with the chosen shade.</li>
							<li>Take out a big brush, and the blush product. Brush blush on face.</li>
						</ol>
						
						<pre> <code>
						//Pseudocode for Rock Paper Scissors
						//Establish win/loss conditions – rock triumphs over scissors triumphs over paper triumphs over rock.
						//Set up gameboard into thirds, opponent’s side, your side, and UI with rock paper scissor icons as choice selections.
						//Computer countdowns for players to make a selection between the three icons.
						//Accept user input
						//Player chooses either rock, paper, or scissors
						//Computer compares the player’s choice to the opponent’s choice
						//Declaration of who wins that round
						//Repeat until the game has been played 3 times
