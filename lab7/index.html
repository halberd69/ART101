			<h1>Lab 7 - Functions</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to experiment with writing and calling functions. We practiced defining functions,
						calling them so they can perform a certain action, as well as calling functions within functions to make code 
						more efficient and concise.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>No problems really arose with this lab, the instructions on the Canvas page were straightforward and easy to follow. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Out of all the labs so far, I feel like this one was the most challenging to understand. The syntax for calling
						functions within functions is something I'm not familiar with, and it took some time to understand how the code 
						was working. The syntax for passing empty arrays through a function was something I didn't catch onto at first, and 
						was confused why some functions didn't include the '' within the parentheses. For example, this line in the js file 
						return userName.split('').sort().join('') was confusing at first because I didn't understand why split had to include the 
						'' symbols while sort didn't. But now I understand, you must include those symbols when passing an array through.
