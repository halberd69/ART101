				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>The challenge of this lab was go back to one of our old labs and fix an issue with JS we had.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p> We initially came across this problem in our last lab with having the values be printed in columns. After 
					revisiting, I had to enlist the help of Wesbot to help us guide towards the right direction. While he was decently 
					helpful with explaining what was happening, his suggestions did not work as expected. Gathering up the knowledge I had,
					I figured out a way to print the values in columns by creating an if statement that checked whether or not "num" was
					divisible by 5, and if so, adding a break to move onto the next line. </p>
		</div>

		<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I am proud of ourselves for being to solve this sort of problem based off the shared knowledge we had about coding. While
					it's not formatted entirely the way I wanted it to be, it does a better job of laying out information than before.
				</p>

				<h2>Debug Results</h2>
					Where should we stop? <input type ="number" min=0 max="1000" id = "max"<br>
					Which factors should print what? <br>
					<table>
						<tr>
							<th>Factor</th>
							<th>Prints what?</th>
