					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>We were tasked with accessing an API endpoint and returning an element from it.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> We had a lot of trouble with this lab because we couldn't get anything from the Canvas or lectures to work, and even
						when we inspected Wes's site we couldn't get the code to work. We theorized that it was because the API endpoint was
						dead, but we played around with commenting some of the code out and somehow the results showed up. We aren't really completely
						sure why this is though. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Every time I think the labs can't get harder they do. This one was especially difficult because we did not have an example
						of what we should expect our output to look like. Nonetheless, I'm satisfied with what we have and that we got it to work eventually. </p>
